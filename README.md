# 👋 Hi, I’m Mesam Tammaar Khan

🧠 **Backend Engineer** | 🔐 **Cybersecurity & Red Teaming Enthusiast**

I build **reliable backend systems and infrastructure-focused services** with a strong emphasis on **performance, security, and correctness**.  
My interests lie at the intersection of **backend engineering, systems programming, and ethical hacking**.

I enjoy working close to the system—designing APIs, building data pipelines, and understanding how software breaks under real-world and adversarial conditions.
